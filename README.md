## Project Description üåà

  _Moody_ is a fun and unique social networking app that blends social media with personal journaling. Our app allows you to make posts about personal events and the emotions you experienced in those moments. These posts are similar to that of a Facebook status with the option of making it only visible to you, like a personal journal entry. Share events in your personal life with your followers or customize your feed and view others' events too! Our mapping and filtering features allow you to view the content that you're in the mood for.
  
  _Moody_ stands out among social media platforms in its focus on mental health: It encourages sharing emotions rather than offensive content and instead promotes conversation. Download it on the google play store today and feel the connection!

## Key Features ‚ú®

## Usage and Setup Instructions üì≤

**1.**  Upon opening the app for the first time, you will be taken to the log-in screen where you can log in with just your username and hit the _Log in_. If you do not have an account, you can create an account with the _Sign Up_ button. All you need is a name and unique username! 

**2.** From now on, the app will automatically take you to the _Feed_ section in the bottom menu bar. This is where you will see the moods of users you follow. If you would like to view your own moods, you can click the spinner at the top left of the screen and click _History_.

**3.** You also have the option to filter the moods in your history or following feed by specific emotional state, reason/description, location (nearby) or time (within the past week).

**4.** When you click on a mood in either of these feeds, you can see more details about it, including its social situation, reason, and location or photo if provided.
   -   If you are in your history feed, you have the option to edit or delete moods you click on.
   -   If you are in your following feed, you can view and leave comments on moods you click on.

**5.** There is a _Search_ button on the bottom left of the screen that takes you to the user search where you can look for users by username.

**6.** There is a _Location_ button on the bottom right of the screen that shows the moods from your feed (history or following, and with the applied filters) on a map, provided that at least one of them has a location.

**7.** With the menu bar at the bottom of the screen, you can navigate off the feed to two other activities: The mood creator and your profile view.

**8.** Selecting _New_ on the menu bar will let you ceate a new mood event which will show up in your mood history as well as your follower's following feeds (if the mood is created as public). The mood must be either private (meaning only you can see it) or public (meaning your followers can see it), and have at least an emotional state and timestamp. You can optionally attach a location, description, social situation, and image to a mood.

**9.** Selecting _Profile_ on the menu bar will take you to a view of your profile and has the following actions:
      - _Requests_: Displays a popup window of incoming follow requests from other users.
      - _Edit_: Allows you to edit your name. (Note: Usernames cannot be changed after signing up)
      - _Friends_: Shows a list of your followers or people you follow
      - _QR Code_: Displays a QR code that links to your user profile for other users to view
      - _Logout_: Logs out of your account and takes you back into the log-in page
